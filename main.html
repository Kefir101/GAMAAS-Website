    <p>Just search up the marketplace and go to a third party review page and you will find plenty of reviews
        that say the website never gave them their money back. </p>
    <h3 id="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>What if I'm buying an account?</b> <i>You may lose your money and get nothing.</i>
            If the seller doesn't give you exactly what you expected and you want a refund, or you both mutually
            agree to cancel for whatever reason, or maybe the seller is actually trying to scam you but you already
            paid, that marketplace website is not giving your money back. You can email them countless times, they will
            claim
            they are working on it, or there is this issue or that issue, or maybe they say nothing at all.
            No matter what they say, you are not getting your money back.</li>
        <li><b>Okay, I get it. What now?</b> Do your research! Scroll through all the marketplaces you find and check
            for any
            reviews that said they were scams. If you can't find any scam reviews, read the positive reviews.
            If they all seem a bit too positive or generic, then that marktplace is realy good at deleting negative
            reviews,
            meaning they are also a scam.</li>
        <li><b>I looked up the reviews, but the average review is so high. How can they be a scam?</b>
            Almost, if not all of those reviews are made by bots/AI, or the marketplace paid people to make fake
            reviews. They have every incentive to trick you, while I do not. I am only here to educate.
            If you keep scrolling through the reviews you will find a handful of reported scams,
            and thats all you need to know to realize they scam everyone.
        </li>
        <li><b>Why are you doing this?</b> I was personally scammed out of $400 for selling a minecraft account on
            PlayerUp, and I don't want anyone else to suffer like me. I lost my account and got no money.
            I only later did the research to find out nobody gets their money. But then I checked the other
            marketplaces, and they were <b>all</b> scams too, so I knew I had to do something.</li>
        <li><b>The marketplace keeps mentioning that I should only use their middleman services because
                there are so many scammers out there. Why would they say that if they are legit?</b>
            This is basic psychology. If they can convince you everyone else is trying to scam you,
            they can lead you to believe they are trustworthy, when in fact you're better off asking a
            random person to be a middleman because you know that the chance they are trustworthy is
            slightly more than zero. For all of these websites, the chance is zero.
        </li>
        <li><b>What do I do if I already sold something and am trying to get my money?</b>
            Some marketplaces have a wallet system where they "give" the money from the buyer to your wallet
            on the website, but then you actually aren't able to transfer the money out of the wallet.
            All you can try to do, if you used a credit card or paypal or any other payment method
            that has a chargeback/dispute ability, is to file a dispute and try to get the buyer refunded.
            Then, hopefully if the buyer is a good person, they will then pay you directly. They may not,
            but you had no chance otherwise. Note: disputes often take months on their end because the marketplace
            will ignore any message requests. But stick with it, eventually the buyer will get the money back.
        </li>
        <li><b>How can I contact you?</b>
            Unfortunately I think a lot of people working at these marketplaces are going to be angry at me,
            so the only way to send me a message is to donate and add a message, that way trolls/haters will
            at least have to support the website to contact me, so that's fine with me.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Don't be fooled when they say that its the middlemen pretenders who steal your money,
        yes, that can happen, but even the "legit" middleman who are part of the website will scam you.
        After all, why wouldnt they? They have no incentive to actually give you back their money.
        They just prey on innocent people who don't do their research and assume
        that the first search result on Google is relatively safe, and then steal their money or account.
    </p>
    <p>If you still don't believe me, then ask yourself this: What do I have to gain from making this website and
        spending my money to pay for ads? I'm not advertising any alternative option. I'm just telling you to do
        your research, and maybe, just maybe you will find a legitimate marketplace.
